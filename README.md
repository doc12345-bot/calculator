# calculator

One step forward, two steps back. I have changed some of the display, altered the CSS a little and tightened a few things up. But, one large bug remains:
the use cannot string together multiple operations without using the = button inbetween calculations. This is quite the problem and I need to go back to the drawing board with this one.
